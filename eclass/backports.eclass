# @BLURB: Applies upstream Git commits to releases
# @DESCRIPTION:
# This eclass facilitates the creation and maintenance of backports versions by
# applying a series of patches fetched from an HTTP-accessible Git repository
# such as GitHub.  The individual patches may be tweaked by specification of a
# sequence of patch mods.  Predefined mods are provided to strip specified
# hunks from upstream patches and to apply local patches to upstream patches
# for the purpose of resolving conflicts.  Additional mods may be user-defined.

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: BACKPORTS
# @REQUIRED
# @DESCRIPTION:
# An array of patch specifications.  These patches will be applied by
# backports_apply_patches() after applying any specified mods to them.  Each
# patch specification consists of a commit hash, optionally followed by a colon
# and a colon-separated list of one or more patch mods.  Each patch mod is the
# name of a mod, optionally followed by an equals sign and some argument for
# the mod.
#
# The following patch mods are predefined:
#
# strip=<regex> - Removes from the patch all hunks whose source file path,
# excluding the leading `a/`, matches the specified regular expression.
#
# pick=<regex> - Removes from the patch all hunks whose source file path,
# excluding the leading `a/`, does not match the specified regular expression.
#
# resolve-conflicts[=<prefix>] - Applies a patch to the patch, typically to
# resolve conflicts that would occur when applying the patch to the source
# files.  The patch patch is read from "${FILESDIR}/${COMMITHASH}.patch", where
# ${COMMITHASH} is the commit hash given at the beginning of the current patch
# specification.  If "${FILESDIR}/<prefix>${COMMITHASH}.patch" exists, then it
# takes precedence.  "<prefix>" defaults to "${PV}-".
#
# Eclass users may define additional patch mods by defining functions named
# backports_mod_MODNAME, where MODNAME is the name of the mod to define.  This
# MODNAME may then be referenced in the sequence of patch mods given in a patch
# specification.  To apply the mod, backports_apply_patches() will invoke the
# user-defined function with ${1} set to a path in ${T}, where the patch may
# be found and modified in place.  If the mod is specified with an argument,
# then such argument will be passed to the user-defined function in ${2}.  The
# user-defined function should die if it fails.

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: BACKPORTS_BASE_URI
# @REQUIRED
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The base URI from which to fetch upstream patches.  This should end in a
# forward slash.  To this base URI will be appended each patch's commit hash
# and ".patch".  You must append $(backports_patch_uris) to SRC_URI to fetch
# these patches.
# @EXAMPLE:
# https://github.com/acme/frobnicator/commit/

# @FUNCTION: backports_patch_uris
# @USAGE: [<suffix>]
# @RETURN: A whitespace-separated list of URIs to be added to SRC_URI.
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Must be called only after setting BACKPORTS.  If suffix is omitted, it
# defaults to ".patch", except if BACKPORTS_BASE_URI matches the pattern
# https://github.com/*/commit/, in which case suffix defaults to
# ".patch?full_index=1".

# @FUNCTION: backports_apply_patches
